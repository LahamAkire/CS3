					<h4>Wicked Whispers</h4>

					One day, I was walking down the hall when people were whispering about me and how I looked. I walked even faster and 
					ignored it at the time. Later that day I heard another group talking about me. I ignored it once again. 
					When I was home and went to lie down I just cried until I could cry no more. I can't take how people treat me anymore.
					I might not be perfect and I see my flaws and I don't need them to point them out to me.
					
					</br></br>
					<h4>Realizing It Hurts</h4>
					All throughout 8th grade me and my two best friends would make fun of anyone who would walk by us during lunch. I never 
					realized how mean we actually were. But during the 2nd half of school Freshman year I lost one of my best friends
					of about 9 years. Soon enough, we became enemies. She didn't have many friends that were underclassmen. So she made 
					friends with these girls whom probably weren't the best influence on her. I would sit home and cry at night praying
					that for some reason I wouldn't have to go to school that day. I never really knew how mean she could be to someone
					she didn't like, until I was that one person she was against. Every chance she got she would make fun of me or my other 
					best friend, making snide remarks. Doing anything she possibly could to hurt us. If I were to list everything she did this
					would turn into a novel. I never thought i would make it through the school year. It was just hard to think that someone 
					that was my best friend could hurt me like that. Thankfully I had my other best friend & we got through the school year
					together. 
					
					</br></br>
					<h4>Locker Room Language</h4>

					I was in gym changing, and a kid decided to call me a fag.. I proudly stated, "is there something wrong with it?" Everyone
					laughed, kids throw clothes at me.. They throw my clothes.. Push me repeatedly.. This happens daily. One day, a kid at 
					the water fountain pushed me, and said "HURRY UP! WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOU FAG!" I turned around with a mouth full of
					water, spit it in his face.. They have never touched, or talked to me since.. Sometimes sticking up for yourself is a good
					thing.. Until it reaches a point.. Violence could lead to worse circumstances. I would see a teacher/school councilperson 
					they do help.<3 It gets better, and you're not alone!
