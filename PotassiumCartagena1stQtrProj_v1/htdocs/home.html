			Bullying is one of the biggest problems in the world. Millions, if not, billions of 
			teenagers are being bullied every singe day. This is something that should be 
			happening less, or not even happening at all. Not everyone can speak up for themselves,
			so speak up for them. We need to spread awareness, and stop bullying 
			once and for all.<br>
